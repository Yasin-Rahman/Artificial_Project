# Artificial_Project

Artificial Intelligence Projects made to determine a country's happiness score based on the country's other attributes like GDP and various other attributes.

Requirements- We made this with Anaconda and python 3.6. Used Spyder as IDE which came preinstalled with Anaconda. Used standard sklearn.LinearRegression package.

Dataset link is given in Dslink.txt. A basic version of the project for demo purpose with repl.it online python notebook is given in Projlink.txt

Project dataset downloaded from Kaggle named World Happiness Report. We modified the dataset and removed redundant information for faster calculation.

We have worked with three happiness report(2015,2016,2017).

Any one of them can be used to perfectly predict other year's happiness score.

How to Run:

Run main.py. It has option to run 2015,2016,2017 or all three of them together for prediction. Check individual file for their own code.

Each of the can be run separately by moving the code out of the function and running it.
