# Artificial_Project(NEW)

Repor for the NEw AI project.

Artificial Intelligence Project made to determine a country's happiness score based on the country's other attributes like GDP and various other attributes.

Requirements- We made this with Anaconda and python 3.6. Used Spyder as IDE which came preinstalled with Anaconda. Used standard sklearn.LinearRegression package.

Dataset link is given in Dslink.txt. A basic version of the project for demo purpose with repl.it online python notebook is given in Projlink.txt

Project dataset downloaded from Kaggle named World Happiness Report. We modified the dataset and removed redundant information for faster calculation.

We have worked with three happiness report(2015,2016,2017).

Any one of them can be used to perfectly predict other year's happiness score. Run comp1617.py for comparison between two year.

### How to Run(Technical):

Run main.py. It has option to run 2015,2016,2017 or all three of them together for prediction. Check individual file for their own code.

Each of the can be run separately by moving the code out of the function and running it.

### About Online Demo:
we have added basic online functionality that works on Appache development server in our home pc which came with XAMPP installation.. 
it only works by running info.php . After running it will show 2017 happiness reports predictions. It is a very early stage of online implementation just for testing purpose.

### How to Run(Non-Technical):

Click the run button of https://repl.it/@yasinshreshto/AIProj page. It will show you a list of all the predicted happines score. While it is not a detailed explanation of the project workings, it will give you a basic idea
